# HR Data Export Tool (Legacy - Progress 4GL)

This repository contains legacy code written in **Progress 4GL**, developed as part of a data integration pipeline between two Human Resources (HR) systems.

## Project Overview

The main purpose of this tool was to **extract, transform, and export employee and payroll-related data** from one legacy HR system to another. The integration was implemented in a corporate environment where both systems had limited interoperability, and data needed to be transferred with minimal disruption.

## Technologies

- Language: **Progress 4GL**
- Target systems: Two on-premise legacy HR platforms
- Deployment: On internal servers (batch execution)

## Features

- Export of employee master data, payroll components and other related information.
- Transformation and formatting of data to meet the target system's import specifications.
- Logging and basic error handling.
- Batch execution support.

## Disclaimer

This code is provided **as-is**, without active maintenance. It represents legacy work and is intended for **reference only**.

- The codebase has not been cleaned or modernized.
- Some naming conventions and structures reflect internal corporate standards at the time of writing.
- All sensitive information has been removed or anonymized.

## Why Share This?

Despite its age, this project demonstrates:

- Real-world experience with system integration and data export in constrained environments.
- The ability to work with and support **legacy systems**, still common in many enterprise environments.
- A practical understanding of Progress 4GL and batch process automation.
